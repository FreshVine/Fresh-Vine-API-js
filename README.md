# Fresh Vine API javascript library  
  
We want to share the scripts that we've used in our internal projects to make it easier for you to build your own tools with Fresh Vine. 


# Library - freshvine.js  
Reviewing this script should make its use pretty straight forward. Prior to use you'll need to setup your applicaiton (in a file that doesn't end up on github!)  

	var FV_API_CLIENT_ID = #####,
		FV_API_CLIENT_SECRET = 'SECRETSTRING',
		FV_API_AUTH_APPROACH = 'key|token',	// What approach is used by your application
		FV_API_SCOPE = 'SCOPE,FOR,YOU,APP',	// OPTIONAL - required for device code
		FV_API_VERSION = 1;	// OPTIONAL
